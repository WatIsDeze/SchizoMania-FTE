# TODO list.
Here we have a todo list, aiming towards the completion of a complete map
in which all game mechanics come on board.

This list (if I don't forget to) will be updated regularly, since it is for
my own ADHD good.

# Things to do (low priority list):
- Move item hover code to View+UpdateWeapon

# Things to research/question (medium priority):
- How to do a proper zombie walk animaton, use offsets so it "moves backwards", to counter the slide effect.

# Things to do for test_prototype map (high priority):
## Mapping for test_prototype.
- Get a basic fade, screen text, and sequences scene going for prototype. [
    -- Needs a player mesh, doing some idle animations.
    -- Needs work on trigger_playerfreeze (crouching disable, mouse disable, inventory disable.
    -- Do some story sentences, and shift back to fps)
]

## Code for test_prototype
- Implement Scripted Sequences with dialogues. (I suppose, an entity which'll send a dialogue event, back and forth? :) )

## Assets.
- Acquire a few Mixamo models, for AI, and NPC's. (Also thus, Brian, the player model)
- Acquire first person view models for a knife, and a pistol. Maybe use Mixamo meshes for the arms/hands?
- Acquire basic sounds for doors, footsteps, ambiance.
