# Things to do:
- Item hover stuff in View+UpdateWeapon

# Things to research/question:
- Scripted Sequences with dialogues. (I suppose, an entity which'll send a dialogue event, back and forth? :) )
- How to do a proper zombie walk animaton, use offsets so it "moves backwards", to counter the slide effect.
