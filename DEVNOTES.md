# Things to do:
- Item hover stuff in View+UpdateWeapon

# Things to research/question:
- gameentity, did we implement this properly? [yes, we have.]
- item pickup does not notify in test_current.bsp [fixed]
- item pickup gflags when dropping are off?
- item pickup hitboxes, not precise. [needs hitboxess in the mesh, create a .iqm test mesh]
- Fix the func_door_rotating
- .iqm meshes, how to?
- Fix barney/scientist UseNPC functionality.
