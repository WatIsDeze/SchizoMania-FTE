<Xylemon> You make a brush, then you can make any kind of patches/curves
<Xylemon> using the curve menu on the selected brush
<Xylemon> on our Texture window (Shift + s) we have "Columns" and "Rows" fields along with the "A" field
<Xylemon> these are related to texture blending in our patches
<Xylemon> think of it as an analog to Sources displacements/texture blending :)
<Xylemon> A = Alpha
<Xylemon> and it can be 0 - 1, so 0.5 would how both textures at half opacity
<Xylemon> we even support alpha blending, so you can blend patches to just alpha, so you can have dirt/dust floor transitions
<Xylemon> something entirely new to Q3BSP with our spec
