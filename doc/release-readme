Getting started
=======================================

1) Get FTE QW for your platform
   http://fte.triptohell.info/downloads

2) Put it into the same directory as this README

3) Run FTEQW

4) Download the content you need via the updater, or provide your own
   copies for the full-version of the games.

Troubleshooting
=======================================

Make sure you're running the latest version of FTEQW.

If your entire engine/binary crashes to desktop or whatever, it's an FTE bug.
Contact #fte at irc.quakenet.org

If you crash to console, contact #freecs at irc.freenode.net or irc.frag-net.com


Notes
=======================================

Things will improve, as they always do.

Thanks and have fun
