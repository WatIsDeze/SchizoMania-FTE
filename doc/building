1. Building all of the game-logic

To build the game-logic for all games, issue 'make' inside the src/
directory of the repository. This requires you to have the latest
fteqcc installed.

2. Building a specific game or mod

For that you'll have to navigate into the client and server directory
of the game you want to compile. For example if you're only wanting to
build the Half-Life game-logic, navigate into src/client/valve, issue
'make' there, then do the same inside src/server/valve.

3. Building the engine

The engine is not part of this project.
However, as of this writing, building the engine is simple.
Checkout/Clone the FTEQW engine repository, then navigate into the
engine/ sub-directory and issue 'make m-rel' there.
This will generate a 'fteqw' binary for your platform in the sub-directory
titled 'release'.

4. Misc notes

To those not in the know, the game-logic is written in QuakeC, it is thus
platform and architecture independent. You do not need to rebuild the logic
for each and every platform. The result will be identical.
