About Nuclide

The Nuclide project produces a freely available game-logic component and 
development platform on top of FTEQW.
Our goals is to create a modern research base for new advancements, features
as well as support games whose formats are supported by FTEQW but their code
isn't freely accessible.

1. Why might I want to use it?

Nuclide is for you when:

- You want to play one of our supported games on the platform/arch of your
  choice.
- You want to develop a game using a lot of complex and well-tested objects
  we have written for you.
- You want to make modifications for a game we support and have full control
  over what you can do.

2. How free is Nuclide?

Everything in Nuclide is free. The copyright terms for the game-logic are
very permitting. Nuclide does not use the GPL as a point of reference, it
instead uses a ISC-like license. This means you can use, copy, modify and
distribute the code and work resulting from it for any purpose.
Please read the very short 'license' document for details.

3. What is the release cycle?

At the current moment, there is no strict release cycle as everthing is
still very early (albeit usable). I am aiming for a stable release cycle of
every 3-6 months once we leave Beta.

4. How can I support the project?

Currently, the only way to support the efforts of the one-man-team behind
this, is to use https://www.paypal.me/eukara/

It was only possible for Nuclide to get this far because of the contributions
of single individuals from the free-software community.
Thanks you so much, everyone who has contributed!
