NUCLIDE CODEBASE CONTRIBUTING RULES

1. The code must be yours.

It's simple: Do not take GPL code. Do not take Half-Life SDK code.
We do not decompile, we reverse-engineer by trial and error.
Also referred to as 'clean-room engineering'.
Most of the behaviour is rather predictable, other is not.

2. Game specific features need to be put into game-specific directories.

Unless other games benefit from this, keep it seperate to one of the game
sub-directories.

That's about it.
