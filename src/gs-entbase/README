GENERAL ENTITY CODE BASE
========================

This is part reverse-engineering effort, part innovation, in terms of reusable
and game-agnostic map-entity logic.

A lot of entities from Half-Life and Source Engine based titles are implemented.
Those are made possible through the documentation efforts of twhl.info
and a lot of trial and error. A lot of mods and custom maps have been used to
make sure this is as compatible as can be. It's always improving.

Others objects I have come up with on my own for the projects.

A few warnings to the uneducated:
If you're planning on merging or using any of this code in combination with the
original Half-Life SDK, you're violating the Half-Life SDK License Agreement.

Thanks to Spike for FTEQCC's advanced features and his engine, FTEQW, that makes
FreeCS and other projects even possible.
