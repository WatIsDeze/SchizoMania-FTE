"targetname"    Name
"target"        Target when triggered.
"delay"         Delay until target is triggered.
"killtarget"    Target to kill when triggered.
"dmg"           Damage inflicted.

Trigger volume that damages everything it touches.

If SF_HURT_ONCE is set, it'll stop once it's been triggered the first time.
If SF_HURT_OFF is set, it needs to be triggered in order to work again.
If SF_HURT_NOPLAYERS is set, it will only NPCs.
If SF_HURT_TOUCHPLAYER is set, it'll only hurt players.
If SF_HURT_FIREONPLAYER is set, it'll only trigger a target if a player
activates it.
